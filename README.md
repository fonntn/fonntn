👋 Hi, I’m Natan!
🎓 I’m an Electrical and Electronic Engineer with postgraduate studies in Industrial Automation and Robotics (IFRJ) and an MBA in Project Management (USP/ESALQ).
💼 I work as a Product Analyst in embedded software development for the automotive industry, with experience in C, C++, Python, MATLAB, Simulink, Model-Based Design, and Ladder logic for Siemens PLCs.
🔬 I'm interested in software development, systems engineering, automotive embedded systems, machine learning, and Computational Neuroscience.
🌱 Currently, I’m deepening my knowledge in machine learning to develop applications that integrate Computational Neuroscience with Electrical/Electronic Engineering.
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, exchange knowledge, and connect with developers and researchers around the world.
